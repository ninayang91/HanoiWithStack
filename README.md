# HanoiWithStack
Implement Hanoi Towers using a stack

Wirte a wrapper class to put n, a, b,c in a Quad class, push Quad into Stack

while(!stack.isEmpty()) stack.pop(). analyze it
                        if q.n==1, print
                        else push q.n-1 into stack, then 1, then q.n-1 into Stack
                        the sequence is different than recursion
